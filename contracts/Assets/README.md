The below descriptions will be modified as we go along the game development. As the alpha is released we will monitor how the users interact with their assets and relevant changes will be made in the below traits of the contract. 

# PLANET

Planets are core to episode 1 — this is where your defence base and battlestation is located. They are the home to the rebellion leaders. Planet is necessary to play the game. Each planet has its own set of unique defence mechanisms (turrets and starships) — they come into action when your planet is under attack by other players. Planets are ERC721 tokens which can be traded on an open marketplace. 

## Traits

A planet is a mintable ERC721 token. It has the following features:-

1. Radius -> Every planet has a size and in our game it is characterised by its radius.
2. Level -> Level of the planet tells about its attack and defence capability. Higher level planets will be difficult to loot. Initially, at the minting time level of the planet will be 1 .
3. Hangar Size -> Hangar size is the number of ships a planet can hold. It acts as a cap on the number of ships a planet can have. When a planet is created, the hangar size will be 3.
4. Cluster ID -> Entire fabula galaxy is divided into clusters of 3 stars and 12 planets. A planet can buy stardust only from the 3 stars in its cluster. Each cluster has a unique ID and thus cluster ID is an important feature of the planet.
5. XP -> XP is the experience gained by the planet. It can be gained by winning battles. To upgrade the planet to next level, the planet must have appropriate XP. All planets will have 0 XP at the time of creation.
6. Stardust -> Stardust is the in-game currency. Every planet has some amount of stardust and its amount has to be maintained optimally. If you have a large amount of stardust, you will become a target for others. On the other hand if you have very low stardust, You won’t be able to buy new ships.
7. Battlestation -> Battlestation is an important feature of a planet. Beside Starships, It is the only defence element of the planet. It has multiple turrets. The maximum number of turrets which can be there in the battlestation is capped by the level of planet. At the time of minting, the planet’s battlestation will be given 4 level 1 turrets.

## How to get a planet

SpaceX Token holders will get 1 planet per token. They can find more planets by using Explorer rockets or can buy planets from the devs. SpaceX Token holders can also sell these planets. 
For players who have missed our presale can buy planets either from the SpaceX token holders or from the devs. SpaceX token holders can choose planet’s price on the basis of demand, supply and level of the planets.
HOW TO INCREASE STARDUST IN THE PLANET ?
Initially, at the minting time, each planet will be given enough stardust to fight some battles. Stardust amount on the planet can be increased either by buying it from the stars associated or by winning battles.

## Trading between planets and stars

In a cluster, each star owner will quote a price for stardust and the associated planets will buy stardust from these stars. Buyer and seller will be anonymous to each other in this trade. For each transaction 20% will go to the devs. Stardust will be transferred from star’s vault to the planet. 

## Brief overview of Battle mechanism

For battle, a planet will attack on another planet. This requires a certain amount of stardust from both planets. Both defending and attacking planets will form battle formations and begin the battle. The one having better formation strategy will win and gain a certain amount of stardust and XP. The losing planet will lose stardust. If the defending planet loses, then a timer of 6 hours will start. During this time, the defending planet cannot be attacked again.

## Planet level up criteria

To level up, A planet has to satisfy certain conditions:-

Number of turrets in the battlestation should be greater than or equal to the number that is required for the next level. A battlestation can have a maximum of 30 turrets.
For the planet to be upgraded to next level, the level of a certain number of turrets in the battlestation has to be greater than the current planet level. This number depends upon the current level of the planet.
XP of the planet should be greater than or equal to the number that is required for the next level.
Stardust Amount of the planet should be greater than or equal to the number required for the next level. After the level up, the stardust required for level up will be deducted from the planet. 
Maximum level for a planet is 5.

## Turrets
Turret’s attacking power increases. Hence the defence of the planet improves.

## Planet level ups 

Number of turrets that can be integrated with the battlestation increases. As a result, the defence capability of the planet increases.
Hangar size of the planet increases. More ships can then be added in the hangar of the planet. As a result, the battle elements of the planet increases.



# STAR

Stars generate stardust which is the in-game currency. There are only 1000 stars in the system and only these stars generate new stardust in the game ecosystem. Stars sell stardust to the planets associated with them. Each star has a operation time, i.e, the time for which they will generate stardust. Operation time for each star will be around the length of Episode 1. Stars have a stardust generation rate which remains almost constant till 70% of the operation time but then falls over the rest of time to zero. It means the star has decayed. 
The entire fabula galaxy will be divided into cluster and each cluster will have 3 stars and 12 planets. Planets can buy stardust from only those stars that are present in their cluster.
At the beginning of the game, all the SpaceX token holders will get a star with some operation time. The remaining of the 1000 stars will be auctioned.

## Traits

A star is a mintable ERC721 token. It has the following features :-

1. Radius :- Radius is one of the basic feature of a star. The rate of stardust generation depends upon the radius of the star.
2. Cluster ID :- Entire fabula galaxy is divided into clusters of 3 stars and 12 planets. A star can sell stardust only to the 12 planets in its cluster. Each cluster has a unique ID and thus cluster ID is an important feature of the star.
3. Operation Time :- Each star has an operation time which is around the length of Episode 1. For around 70% of the operation time, stars will generate stardust at nearly a constant rate. The rate will fall to zero over the remaining time. When the rate of stardust generation becomes zero, the star is said to be decayed.
4. Rate :- Stardust is being generated in the star during its operation time, but at what Rate? In the game, the rate of stardust generation is a mathematical function of time.
5. Vault :- The stardust generated is stored in the vault. Star owners can only sell the stardust that is in the vault. The generated stardust can be harnessed and added to the vault after a day’s interval.

## How to get a star

SpaceX Token holders will get 1 star per token. More stars can be bought at the star auction. Token holders can also sell stars to others.
Other players can either buy stars from SpaceX Token holders or get them at the star auction.
TRADING BETWEEN PLANETS AND STARS
In a cluster, each star owner will quote a price for stardust and the associated planets will buy stardust from these stars. Buyer and seller will be anonymous to each other in this trade. For each transaction 20% will go to the devs. Stardust will be transferred from star’s vault to the planet.

## Advantage of owning a star

Stars provide revenue to the star owners.
Owners have control over the price. They can charge any price (between some range) for their stardust.


# STARSHIPS

Spaceships are the main attacking units. They have various types, Bombers, Raiders, Troop Carriers, Healers, Destroyers and Cruisers. Using various types of spaceships in attack will be one of the main strategic points of the game. They will have their respective strengths and weaknesses. Each starship is associated with a planet. It can be sold by the owner in the market.

## Traits

A starship is a mintable ERC721 token. It has the following features:-

1. Rarity :- A very important characteristic of a starship is its rarity. There are 4 levels of rarities and other ship traits improve with rarity.
Speed :- Speed is an important trait of a ship. Quicker ships are difficult to target and are also good for looting stardust.
2. Level :- Level of the ship determines the number of turrets and defence as well speed of the ship. Rare ships with high level are very difficult to defeat. If you are an enemy, then it will be best to avoid high level rare ships.
3. Attack Ability :- The ship’s most important characteristic is its attack. Ships with higher attack inflict more damage and can effectively penetrate the defence of the planet. The attacking power is directly
4. Defence Capabilities :- Defence is also an important characteristic of a ship. Even the best attacking ships are nothing if their defence is too weak.
5. Battle Stardust :- It is the amount of stardust required by the ship for 1 battle. It increases with level and rarity.

## How to get a starship?

SpaceX token holders will get 3 starships per token. These starships will be of level 1 but for rarity, there is a probability distribution. Token holder can get rarity 1 (common) ship with 80% probability, rarity 2 ship with 15% probability, rarity 3 ship with 4% probability and rarity 4 (very very rare) ship with 1% probability only. Ships are also available in the market.
Other players can buy various ships from market in the game.

## Level up criteria

To level up, A starship has to satisfy certain conditions:-

## Number of turrets in the starship should be greater than or equal to the number that is required for the next level. A ship can have a maximum of 30 turrets.

For the ship to be upgraded to next level, the level of a certain number of turrets in the ship has to be greater than the current ship level. This number depends upon the current level of the ship.
There is a certain amount of stardust that has to be paid to the upgrade the ship. Also, a certain amount of stardust has to be paid to level up the turret.
Maximum level for a ship is 5.

## Effect of turret level Up 

Turret’s attacking power increases. Hence the defence as well as the attack of the ship improves.

## Effects of ship level Up

Number of turrets that can be integrated with the ship increases. As a result, the battle capability of the ship increases.
Speed of the ship increases as level goes up.
Stardust required for battle also increases with increasing level and rarity.

## Ship Trading

The procedure for ship buying and selling is as follows :-

Initially, the owner of the ship quote a price for the ship. With this step, the ship is put on sale. After this, the seller waits for the buyer.
Interested buyer will buy the ship at the price quoted. 95% of the money transferred will go to the ship owner and 5% to the devs.
The ship will be transferred to the buyer and the seller will receive the money. In the whole transaction, the buyer and seller will be anonymous to each other.
Once the ship is put on sale, the owner of the ship can also put the ship off sale if he wants to.
TYPES OF SHIPS
There are 7 types of ships in the game:-

1. Battle-Cruiser :- Large Ships with heavy attack but low speed and reloading. Can be used in a battle only once. But even 1 attack is sufficient for the destruction of an entire enemy defence line.
2. Bomber :- Bombers are ships with high attack but very feeble defence. Their speed is also high. They are used to destroy enemy’s defence.
3. Troop Carrier :- High speed but low attack and defence. Carry troops which makes them very effective in looting stardust.
4. Destroyer :- Heavy attack with medium speed and defence. It has a large number of turrets which makes the enemy tremble on seeing them.
5. Healer :- Healers are not directly used in battle. They are used to heal other ships. They have high defence but their attack is almost zero.
6. Raider :- Raiders are ships which are very effective in looting stardust. They have high speed, medium defence and low attack.
7. Kamikaze :- Kamikaze are suicide ships that can be used in a battle only once. Their attack power and speed are very high but their defence is almost 0.

## Starship Turrets

Starships feature a range of attacking turrets all of which have different abilities and powers. These turrets determine the overall strength of your starship. Some turrets like the Radar Deflectors give stealth ability to Raider class ships. As starships are upgraded, more turrets get attached to the ships increasing their attack and defence abilities.
